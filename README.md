# News-frontend
* This __React__ application is a frontend part of my graduate __MERN__ stack project for a Web Developer course by [Practicum](https://practicum.com). This application uses API, which is created in a [separate repository](https://github.com/SoniaNeimark/news-explorer-api) and is hosted on [the server](https://api.sonia-news.students.nomoredomainssbs.ru/) where the __Express__ application is running on top of __Node JS__.
